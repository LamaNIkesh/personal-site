Hi! I am an aspiring data scientist looking to transition into the industry from academic research. 

I completed my MSc and then a PhD in computational neuroscience from Nottingham Trent University (NTU) in September 2020. I studied neuronal dynamics and connectivity during induced learning in an in-vitro model of the brain. I conducted experiments to record neuronal signals and develop protocols to induce long term memory (low-level learning) in neuronal cultures. I also developed a computational pipeline to process the recordings and algorithms to infer brain connectivity.  

Since then I have worked as a research fellow in CNCR lab at NTU where I worked in developing deep learning models for meta-imitation learning. During this period I became fascinated with the area of artificial intelligence and applying data science techniques to solve real-world problems. I enjoy building statistical and machine learning models to solve real-world problems and want to learn and grow further as an AI/Data Scientist. 

During my free time, I enjoy cycling, running, cooking and playing guitar. Currently, I am learning video editing and music composition.
